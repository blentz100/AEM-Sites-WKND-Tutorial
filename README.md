## WKND Tutorial Overview ✅

There are two main ways to start an AEM project: 

1. AEM Project Archetype using a Maven template. This is recommended for sites that expect heavy customization. 

2. AEM Site Template - aka - Quick Site Creation.

Finished site: https://wknd.site/us/en.html


### Project Archetype
  

✅ Overview

✅ 1 - Project Setup 

✅ 2 - Component Basics 

Went over HTL, Sling models and how to integrate client side libraries like Sass, Less and Typescript (using npm watch)
  
✅ 3 - Pages and Templates 

This section covers the differences between base page components and editable templates.

Planning for most new sites starts with some mockups using a design tool like Adobe XD, which will be used in this example. 

Experience Fragments are useful in that they allow you to combine multiple elements into a single reusable component like a header or footer

Submitted two PRs on this section.
